Step 1 : Transfer iperf testing tool to NON root cell
 
 #scp -r /root/sanket/iperf root@12.220.59.30:/usr/bin/

Step  2 : Execute iperf on Non Root cell as Server

For TCP server 
 # iperf -s 

For UDP server
 # iperf -s -u

Step 3 : Execute iperf on Root Cell as client

FOr TCP Client
 # iperf -c 172.24.0.95 ( replace this ip 172.24.0.95 with non root cell ip)

For UDP Client
 # iperf -c 172.24.0.95 -u 


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For More Details

FOr TCP server
 # iperf -s -p 2000

For TCP Client
# iperf -c 172.24.0.95 -t 20 -p 2000 -w 40k


-t  option used in the above command tells to transfer data for 20 seconds.

-p  will tell the client to connect the port 2000 on the server

-w will specify your desired window size value. As i told before, window size tuning will improve TCP transfer rate to a certain extent.


You can also tell the iperf client to show the transfer rate at an interval of 1 second, for the whole 10 second transfer, as shown below with -i option.


-i option iperf client to show the transfer rate at an interval of 1 second

# iperf -c 172.24.0.95 -P 1 -i 1


Check the throughput report by increasing the number of parallel connections using "iperf".

# iperf -c 172.24.0.95 -P 20 -i 5

-P number of parallel connections


---------

UDP server

# iperf -s -u


UDP client 

# iperf -c 172.24.0.95 -u -b 100m

 -u options needs to be also used on the client side for specifying UDP traffic.
 
 -b option to specify the bandwidth to use
